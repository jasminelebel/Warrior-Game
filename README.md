# Warrior-Game
Java Warrior Game for two players

Two players, one turn each, roll a pair of two die, and the sum of these die corresponds 
to the new position they will take on the generated array board. Point of the game is to
have a player reach the highest step of the last board, where it will be declared as a 
winner. Throughout the course of the game, players will win and lose energy units based 
on where they land on the board. Players will also win or lose energy or change position 
if a player lands on the same position as the other player and is given the option to challenge 
or forfeit. This gives the player a 50% chance to either steal other player's position 
and/or lose half of their energy units. Player always needs more than 0 energy units, 
and loop loops the game until one of the two players is declared a winner.
